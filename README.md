In this case study, I explored BigQuery's public dataset on homelessness from 2010 - 2018 to draw insights into the trends. I modified the dataset using SQL to allow for more efficient analysis, including removing columns and creating new columns. I also performed data analysis using SQL queries to identify locations that need support for homeless youth and homeless veterans, in addition to sourcing locations that were effectively supporting their homeless population.
